Every morning before sunrise, he visited the Shiv temple, then inspected his farms, shops, and stables. His son, Sumit, was the opposite—lazy and unwilling to work. While his father rose early, Sumit remained in bed, refusing his father's calls to help with the business.\n\nThe moneylender grew deeply disappointed, but his pleas fell on deaf ears. Years later, he fell ill and died, leaving his thriving business to Sumit and his wife. Yet Sumit showed no interest in managing the enterprise. Without his father's watchful presence, the business crumbled, and losses mounted rapidly.\n\nDesperate, Sumit's mother approached him. \"Son, our business is failing. We face enormous losses. You must help.\" Sumit confessed his ignorance. \"Mother, I know nothing of business. Father never taught me because I was always lazy.\"\n\nHis mother offered a solution. \"Your grandfather in the next village has great knowledge of this business. Go seek his wisdom.\"\n\nThe next morning, Sumit visited his grandfather and explained their situation. His grandfather listened and then revealed his advice: \"Follow your father's path exactly. Wake before sunrise, visit the Shiv temple, then inspect all your farms, shops, and stables every single day.\"\n\nSumit agreed eagerly and began the very next morning. He woke before dawn, visited the temple, and made his rounds through all his properties without fail.\n\nThe workers noticed this sudden change. They whispered among themselves: \"The boss now comes every day! We can no longer get away with our schemes.\" Fear gripped them—they had grown accustomed to stealing from the absent owner through various fraudulent practices. With Sumit present daily, they knew they would be caught.\n\nOne by one, the laborers abandoned their dishonest activities and began working honestly. As the scams ceased, so did the losses. The business stabilized, then flourished. Within weeks, prosperity returned to the family.\n\nGrateful and amazed, Sumit returned to his grandfather. \"Grandfather, you've performed a miracle! Our business thrives again because of your wisdom!\"\n\nHis grandfather smiled knowingly. \"My boy, I did nothing. You accomplished this through your own hard work. But understand—your previous wealth was lost because of your laziness. The workers exploited your absence and committed countless frauds. Now that you're present daily, they fear being caught and work honestly. Your discipline transformed everything.\"\n\nSumit finally understood the lesson his father had tried to teach him. Laziness had nearly destroyed his family's fortune, while dedication and hard work had restored it. From that moment, he abandoned his indolent ways and became a hardworking man, honoring his father's legacy.\n\n## Moral\n\nLaziness breeds problems and invites others to take advantage.

Years later, he fell ill and died, leaving his thriving business to Sumit and his wife. Yet Sumit showed no interest in managing the enterprise. Without his father's watchful presence, the business crumbled, and losses mounted rapidly.\n\nDesperate, Sumit's mother approached him. \"Son, our business is failing. We face enormous losses. You must help.\" Sumit confessed his ignorance. \"Mother, I know nothing of business. Father never taught me because I was always lazy.\"\n\nHis mother offered a solution. \"Your grandfather in the next village has great knowledge of this business. Go seek his wisdom.\"\n\nThe next morning, Sumit visited his grandfather and explained their situation. His grandfather listened and then revealed his advice: \"Follow your father's path exactly. Wake before sunrise, visit the Shiv temple, then inspect all your farms, shops, and stables every single day.\"\n\nSumit agreed eagerly and began the very next morning. He woke before dawn, visited the temple, and made his rounds through all his properties without fail.\n\nThe workers noticed this sudden change. They whispered among themselves: \"The boss now comes every day! We can no longer get away with our schemes.\" Fear gripped them—they had grown accustomed to stealing from the absent owner through various fraudulent practices. With Sumit present daily, they knew they would be caught.\n\nOne by one, the laborers abandoned their dishonest activities and began working honestly. As the scams ceased, so did the losses. The business stabilized, then flourished. Within weeks, prosperity returned to the family.\n\nGrateful and amazed, Sumit returned to his grandfather. \"Grandfather, you've performed a miracle! Our business thrives again because of your wisdom!\"\n\nHis grandfather smiled knowingly. \"My boy, I did nothing. You accomplished this through your own hard work. But understand—your previous wealth was lost because of your laziness. The workers exploited your absence and committed countless frauds. Now that you're present daily, they fear being caught and work honestly. Your discipline transformed everything.\"\n\nSumit finally understood the lesson his father had tried to teach him. Laziness had nearly destroyed his family's fortune, while dedication and hard work had restored it. From that moment, he abandoned his indolent ways and became a hardworking man, honoring his father's legacy.\n\n## Moral\n\nLaziness breeds problems and invites others to take advantage.
